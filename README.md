# Secure IoT-Based Smart Monitoring System

## 🔍 Abstract
The implementation of the proposed secure IoT-based smart monitoring system addresses the limitations of conventional IoT architectures by incorporating a robust, security-centric framework. At the core of this system are two independently operating microcontroller units, each interfaced with a distinct set of sensors tailored to specific monitoring requirements. These microcontrollers are responsible for the local collection, encryption, and preliminary processing of sensor data. Data is encrypted using AES before transmission, ensuring secure communication. Role-based access control and real-time intrusion detection enhance overall system security. The decentralized structure improves resilience and scalability, making the solution viable for critical sectors such as healthcare, industry, and infrastructure.

## 💻 Software Used
- **WAMP Server** – Hosting the dashboard and backend in PHP
- **Firebase** – Real-time database and alert notification
- **PyCharm** – Python-based backend processing
- **HTML/CSS/JS/PHP** – Frontend dashboard for monitoring

## ✅ Advantages
- High data security with AES encryption
- Real-time intrusion detection
- Decentralized architecture increases reliability
- Role-based access ensures only authorized usage
- Flexible and scalable for multiple use cases

---

## ❌ Disadvantages
- Increased cost due to dual microcontroller usage
- Initial configuration and setup complexity
- Requires consistent internet connection for alerts

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate machine learning for adaptive threat detection
- Add blockchain for immutable data logging
- Enable OTA (Over-the-Air) firmware updates
- Expand to 5G for higher data transfer speed
- Enhance GUI dashboards and cross-platform interoperability
